## Morning reflection
### Housekeeping
1. Announced tomorrow: 
    - Draft - Assignments 4 & 5
    - Draft - Final Project
    - Groups for Final Project

## 1. The `http` builtin module
### Learning Objectives
- Create a simple `http` server using Node.
- Understand when code is executed:
  - on initial script execution;
  - when a `request` event occurs.
- Start a server on port `8080`.

### Materials
- Gist: [Create a local `http` server](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/4f96eefab57e9ab8d2ec4e21f6029be3)

### Key Takeaways
- You have to restart the server before it loads new changes.
- The `http` module allows us to create servers without installing dependencies but it requires a lot of work to setup the features that a production server requires (`404` handling, reading HTML files from the file system, etc).
- Starting tomorrow, we'll use `npm` to install the `express` framework, which simplifies the creation and management of web servers.

---

## 2. An introduction to `npm`
### Learning Objectives
- Define [common terminology for `npm` projects](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/9a52204b37465c860decd481ab130727).
- Summarize the history of `npm`.
- Define the problem that `npm` solves.
- Understand [semantic versioning](https://nodejs.dev/learn/semantic-versioning-using-npm) and `update` rules.
  - `~1.2.3`: Auto-update patch releases (`1.2.x`)
  - `^1.2.3`: Auto-update minor releases (`1.x`)

### Materials
- Gist: [An introduction to `npm`](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/01ce4933169a17011659c525233442b5)

### Key Takeaways
- `npm` is great but it has a weakness: it's hosted by a single registry that can go offline. When this happens, it's impossible to `install` and `update` dependencies. 

---

## 3. Creating `npm` projects
### Learning Objectives
- Recognize the presence/absence of an `npm` project.
- Understand the [anatomy of a `package.json` file], specifically:
  - `name`: name of the project
  - `main`: Entry script filename (i.e. `app.js`, `server.js`, etc)
  - `scripts`: Command line shortcuts
  - `dependencies`: Project production dependencies
  - `devDependencies`: Project Development dependencies
- Initialize a new `npm` project

### Materials
- [Anatomy of a `package.json` file](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/nodejs-package-json)
- Gists: [`npm` - Getting started](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/d57f41d7c18d0d198263c7bc3ab230e3)

### Key Takeaways
- `npm` projects are usually in the same root directory as a `git` repository.
- Don't initialize projects within projects.
- Add `node_modules` to your `.gitignore` file to avoid storing needless files in your repository.
- Commit `package.json` and `package-lock.json` to your repository.
- Don't manually edit `package-lock.json`. This is maintained by `npm` to lock dependencies to specific versions/ranges.
- Update `package.json` by the command line (or other tool) unless you're comfortable editing the file manually.

## 4. Installing new dependencies
### Learning Objectives
- Evaluate an `npm` package vs alternatives.
- Install a package from the `npm` registry.
- Import a package into a Node app.

### Materials
- Activities: 
  - [Install DayJS using `npm`](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/232d9c9a0997692483fca51b6f624a61)

### Key Takeaways
- `momentjs` is an industry favourite for handling dates but even [the maintainers recommend more modern alternatives](https://momentjs.com/docs/#/-project-status/).
- There are many `npm` options for date handling. Here's a [handy breakdown](https://medium.com/swlh/best-moment-js-alternatives-5dfa6861a1eb) of the most popular ones.

## Open lab-time
### Activities
1. Using the internet and the simple `http` server created earlier today, figure out how to send the requested URL as a response instead of "Hello World".
2. Output a fancy date to a web site.
    1. [Create a simple `http` server](https://gist.github.com/acidtone/4f96eefab57e9ab8d2ec4e21f6029be3);
    2. Initialize a new `npm` project;
    3. Install `dayjs` as a dependency;
    4. Load `dayjs` into the `http` script;
    5. Add a fancy date to the "Hello World" message sent by the server.
3. Practice downloading dependencies:
    1. Complete the above activity and create an `http` server with `dayjs` as a dependency.
    2. Delete your `node_modules` directory.
    3. Try starting your server. You should get the following error:

        ```
        Error: Cannot find module 'module-name'
        ```
    
    4. Download your dependencies:
        
        ```
        $ npm install
        ```

    5. Try starting the server again and everything should be amazing.
4. Confirm you are [ignoring the `node_modules` directory](https://docs.github.com/en/github/using-git/ignoring-files) in Git:
    1. Create a new `npm` project with an installed dependency of your choice.
    2. Initialize a new git repo.
    3. Create a remote repo for this project on GitHub.
    4. Push your local code to the remote.
    5. Confirm that the remote repo _does not_ have a `node_modules` directory.
5. Prep for tomorrow: create a new `npm` project and install `express` as a dependency.
